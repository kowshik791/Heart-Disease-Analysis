# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** developed using Tableau to explore patterns, risk factors, and insights related to cardiovascular disease.
The dashboard enables users to analyze patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical attributes to understand how they influence heart disease occurrence.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate data visualization skills, healthcare analytics understanding, and the ability to derive meaningful insights from structured datasets.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze heart disease distribution across demographic groups
* Identify key risk factors influencing heart disease occurrence
* Visualize relationships between lifestyle habits and heart health
* Build an interactive dashboard for exploratory analysis
* Provide insights useful for healthcare awareness and research

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard includes multiple interactive visualizations:

### 🔹 Gender vs Heart Disease

Displays heart disease distribution across male and female populations.

### 🔹 Diabetic vs Stroke Analysis

Explores relationships between diabetes, stroke, and heart disease risk.

### 🔹 Race-wise Heart Disease Distribution

Pie chart showing prevalence of heart disease across different racial groups.

### 🔹 Smoking & Alcohol Impact

Examines the combined impact of smoking and alcohol consumption on heart disease occurrence.

### 🔹 Interactive Filters

Users can dynamically filter dashboard views based on:

* Heart disease status
* Diabetes condition
* Stroke history
* Race category
